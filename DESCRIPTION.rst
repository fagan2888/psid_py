A package to build PSID panel datasets
======================================

This package is based heavily on the one by Florian Oswald found at https://github.com/floswald/psidR/.  Also, the ``read_sas()`` and ``parse_sas()`` functions are based heavily on those by Anthony Joseph Damico (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SAScii/index.html).
